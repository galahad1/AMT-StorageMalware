<%-- 
This is a very basic JSP page. Notice that we can include other JSPs (so that we
can use the header and the footer across different pages). In this case, it is
a static include, which means that the header and footers will be included when
the JSP is compiled into a servlet.

The servlet (controller) that received the initial HTTP request and delegated
rendering of the view to this JSP did not send us any model. We only display
static content.

  By the way, this page only contains static content (no model provided by the
  servlet and used by the view).
