<%-- 
This is a very basic JSP page. Notice that we can include other JSPs (so that we
can use the header and the footer across different pages). In this case, it is
a static include, which means that the header and footers will be included when
the JSP is compiled into a servlet.

The servlet (controller) that received the initial HTTP request and delegated
rendering of the view to this JSP did not send us any model. We only display
static content.
