# AMT-StorageMalware

AMT-StorageMalware is a web application to store data about malware.

## Prerequisites
Docker and docker-compose installed

## Quick-Start
To use this application you have to follow these steps
* Clone the repository
* Navigate to the directory `AMT-StorageMalware/topology-amt/`
* Once in this directory there is a docker-compose.yml file, here, execute `docker-compose up --buid` to create the container of the database and the application (this operation can take a while)
* Once the container is properly started, go to the following link: [localhost:8080/storagemalware/](localhost:8080/storagemalware/) to use the web application
    > You can also go with \<container ip address\>:8080/storagemalware

## Administration

Several operations are possible:

You can edit the database by adding new malware.
* You can add a single malware with the creation page
* You can generate random malware with the generate page

You can also edit or delete malware stored in the database
* On the home page you will have links to click on

To administrate the database from the web application you have to authenticate with admin@storage:adminpw

On initialization we have inserted some malware in the database, if you want to change those data
you can edit the file `AMT-StorageMalware/images/mysql/data/b_malware_data.sql`

You can also administrate the database with phpmyadmin on localhost:6060
root:adminpw

## Template BootStrap

In this webApp we have used a BooStrap to get the general layout of the main page. We have used a footer and a header to get some resemblance between the different pages. We have also used some personalized css for the main elements that are inside our pages. For example the formular for creating a new Malware.
